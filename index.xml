      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-immunity&#34;&gt;What is immunity?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is the ability to recognize foreign substances in our body, and our body tries to reduce them.&#xA;It also destroys dead or damaged cells.It consists of extensive networks of cells and tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;innate-immunity&#34;&gt;Innate immunity&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Has no memory so it reacts instantly and always by the same mechanism. It is mainly made up of white blood cells (monocytes) that constantly circulate in the blood to enter the blood vessels in the event of an inflammatory reaction. They move into the tissues and thus become macrophages (pathological waste eaters), which are made of foreign and dead cells (pathogens). This also includes the barrier function of the body, which is the skin, respiratory epithelium, gastric juices, etc. The skin secretes antibacterial latices in sebum. the respiratory epithelium produces mucus and helps remove debris from the airways. Gastric juices remove bacteria and toxins from ingested food.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
